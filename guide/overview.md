# Guide - Creating a Cadmus Project

Creating a full Cadmus project with its backend and frontend layers happens in 3 steps:

1. [create the backend models](./backend.md).
2. [create the backend API](./api.md).
3. create the frontend app with its part/fragment editors libraries.

Step 1 is required only if you are going to add new models (parts/fragments). If you are just reusing existing models, you can proceed directly to step 2.

In what follows, the project's name (e.g. `Itinera`, `Pura`, `Tgr`, `Bdm`...) is abbreviated as `<PRJ>`.

## Requirements

All the requirements are freeware tools.

- Visual Studio Community Edition or higher (backend; `VS` for short)
- NodeJS, Angular (frontend) and your favourite code editor (`VSCode` is suggested)
- Docker (deployment)
